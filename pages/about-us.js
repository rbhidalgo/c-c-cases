				<p className={styles.heading__subtitle}>Meet the Founder</p>
    <p>Elias Chavez is the person behind laying the foundation for C&C Cases Inc. His expertise in the transport case industry goes back to the year 1991. In 2005, he seized an opportunity to start his own business—C&C Cases Inc. With his family's help, he turned their home garage into a 2,800 sq ft location for production. Francisco Chavez is the current owner and CEO of C&C Cases Inc. He is dedicated to carrying on the legacy of his father and providing premium-grade road cases with guaranteed customer satisfaction. </p>
				<p className={styles.heading__subtitle}>A Word from the CEO</p>
    <p>Our company has been building custom-made road cases for over 15 years, and we're proud to have served our customers with excellent customer service and world-class products. The business was started by my father, and I am proud of our heritage. It's important for us that every customer feels like they're part of our family as well. As a next-generation CEO, I plan to take the company forward by continuing our tradition of excellence and innovation while also keeping an eye on what's happening in the global market. I'm hoping that my experience will help us stay ahead of the curve and continue growing our business. I am excited to see what the future holds for us all.</p>
